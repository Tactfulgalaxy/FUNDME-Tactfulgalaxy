FundMe - A Decentralized Crowdfunding Platform
Welcome to the FundMe project, a smart contract-based crowdfunding platform. Built using Solidity and Foundry, this project leverages the transparency and immutability of blockchain technology to facilitate secure and efficient fundraising.

🚀 Features
Decentralized and Transparent: Contributions and withdrawals are tracked and visible on the blockchain.
Secure Transactions: Ensures only authorized withdrawals via role-based access.
Optimized Gas Costs: Includes efficient price conversions using Chainlink Oracles.
Testing and Mocks: Comprehensive unit and integration tests ensure reliability.

🛠 Tech Stack
Foundry: Development and testing framework for Solidity.
Solidity: Smart contract programming language.
Chainlink: Oracles for real-time price feeds.

📦 Installation and Usage
Prerequisites
Install Foundry.
Ensure access to an Ethereum-compatible wallet (e.g., MetaMask).

Steps
1 Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fundme-foundry.git
cd fundme-foundry

2 Install dependencies:
forge install

3 Configure your .env file with:
PRIVATE_KEY: Your wallet private key.
RPC_URL: Your blockchain provider's URL (e.g., Alchemy or Infura).
4 Deploy the contract:
forge script script/DeployFundMe.s.sol --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
5 Run tests:
    forge test
